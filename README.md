## Overview

This is an analysis of Moonshot AI's Kimi K2.5 agent architecture and source code. No authentication was bypassed. No binaries were decompiled. Everything here was visible to a regular user with patience and curiosity.

Kimi shifted from tool-use architectures to skill-based environment architectures. Instead of giving the model discrete APIs, it gives the model general-purpose computing contexts: persistent filesystems, browser automation, and process execution. The model acts as an operating system user rather than an API consumer.

## What This Repository Contains

System prompts for six agent types: Base Chat, OK Computer, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Websites. Skill definitions for DOCX, XLSX, PDF, and WebApp output formats. Tool schemas documenting 37 distinct tools. [Source code samples](source-code-sample/) for the runtime environment. Technical analysis of the architecture, security model, and design patterns.

## Key Insights

**Tool Budget Matters More Than Model Size**

The same model with a persistent filesystem and 50 tool calls produces deliverables. The same model in a chat window with 10 calls answers questions. The difference is infrastructure, not intelligence.

**Skills Beat Fine-Tuning**

Kimi creates a "Sheets Agent" not by training a new model, but by forcing it to read 925 lines of Excel documentation before it starts. Context creates specialization.

**Documentation for Objectivity, Personas for Taste**

Spreadsheets have right answers, so Kimi uses skill files. Presentations require judgment, so Kimi uses a McKinsey consultant persona.

## Methodology

I got this information through conversation with Kimi and source code extraction through [OK Computer](https://kimi.com/agent). Everything documented here was accessible through standard user interfaces.

**Independent verification:**
- [kimi.com/chat](https://kimi.com/chat) — Base Chat with 10 tool calls
- [kimi.com/agent](https://kimi.com/agent) — OK Computer with full tool access
- [kimi.com/docs](https://kimi.com/docs), [kimi.com/sheets](https://kimi.com/sheets), [kimi.com/slides](https://kimi.com/slides), [kimi.com/websites](https://kimi.com/websites) — Specialized agents
