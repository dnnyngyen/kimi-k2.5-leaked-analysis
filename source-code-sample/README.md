## Files

| File | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| [`browser_guard.py`](browser_guard.py) | 41KB | Playwright-based browser automation framework. This is the largest module by far. It handles Chromium control, anti-detection measures, and web interaction workflows. See the deep dive in [`../deep-dives/runtime/browser-automation.md`](../deep-dives/runtime/browser-automation.md). |
| [`jupyter_kernel.py`](jupyter_kernel.py) | 17KB | IPython kernel for sandboxed code execution. Manages the ZeroMQ sockets, JSON messaging protocol, and execution loop. Runs as processes 300-400 in the container. Details in [`../deep-dives/runtime/code-execution.md`](../deep-dives/runtime/code-execution.md). |
| [`kernel_server.py`](kernel_server.py) | 10KB | FastAPI control plane for the agent environment. Exposes port 8888 for health checks and kernel lifecycle management. This is how the outer system controls the sandbox. Architecture documented in [`../deep-dives/runtime/control-plane.md`](../deep-dives/runtime/control-plane.md). |
| [`utils.py`](utils.py) | 1.2KB | Shared utility functions. Small but essential helper code used across the other modules. |

## Architecture

These four files implement the four-layer container architecture:

```
Layer 1: Control Plane (FastAPI)
├── kernel_server.py (port 8888)
├── Health checks
├── Kernel lifecycle management
└── 10KB Python module

Layer 2: Compute Engine (IPython)
├── jupyter_kernel.py (PID 300-400)
├── ZeroMQ sockets
├── JSON over WebSocket
└── 17KB module

Layer 3: Web Tools (Playwright)
├── browser_guard.py (41KB)
├── Chromium 120.x
└── Ports 9222/9223

Layer 4: User Workspace
├── /mnt/kimi/ (Base Chat)
└── /mnt/okcomputer/ (OK Computer)
```

The control plane manages the compute engine. The compute engine executes user code. The web tools provide browser automation. The workspace provides persistent storage. Each layer depends on the one below it.

## Security Model

**Network isolation** blocks external access at the container level. The agent cannot curl google.com directly. All web access goes through the browser tools, which have their own controls.

**Resource limits** enforce a 30-minute timeout and 500MB memory limit. This prevents runaway processes from consuming excessive resources.

**Filesystem restrictions** vary by agent mode. Base Chat gets read-only access. OK Computer gets full read-write access to its workspace.

**Sandboxed execution** isolates all code in a controlled environment. Even if the agent executes malicious Python, it cannot escape the container.
