## Key Insights Summary

**1. Context is Specialization**

You do not need fine-tuning to create a "Sheets Agent". You just need to force-feed it the right documentation.

**2. Persona is for Taste**

Technical tasks get skill documentation. Creative tasks get expert personas.

**3. Skills vs. Personas**

Skill scaffolding works for objective correctness. Persona replacement works for subjective excellence.

Skill scaffolding uses procedural documentation. Persona replacement uses character embodiment.

Skill scaffolding validates with binary pass or fail. Persona replacement validates with qualitative compelling assessment.

Docs, Sheets, and Websites use skill scaffolding. Slides uses persona replacement.
